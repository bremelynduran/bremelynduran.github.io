            <h2> MY THREE STRENGTHS </h2>
            <h3> FUTURE THINKER</h3>

            <p>My mind loves to think and dream about the future. I am a person who likes to think about what I can do, not what I can not do.I like to imagine the life I will have, what new things will be invented, and what
I will be able to do that I cannot do now. What kind of person will I be? How will the world be different in 10 years or 100 years? If my dreams will come true or not? I like to think about the important things in life and
what they mean. Finding meaning is important to me. It is not enough for me to simply concentrate on what I need to do today because my mind needs more
adventure than that. I spend time thinking about ideas, not just facts. Thinking big and painting pictures of what my future will be like. </p>
<h4> HOW I USE THIS STRENGTH</h4>
<p> I like to think about what can happen if I act a certain way. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> ORGANIZER</h3>

<p> Scheduling, planning, and organizing my world makes life better. People count on me to get the details
right and pull a plan together.I like to create order in my world. Schedules help me feel in control of
my life. Planning makes me comfortable and calm about what I am going to do. It is fun to think
ahead, organize, and include all that I want to do in my plans so that I don't leave anything out. I like
to think about both the big ideas and the details. It feels good to make something absolutely perfect,
whether it is as simple as my hair or as complicated as a big project for school. It is important for me to be
on time or even early so that I can be ready to start whatever I am about to do. Not only do I like order and
rules for myself, I like them for other people too. I help myself and others by pulling all the pieces
together.</p>
<h3> RELATING</h3>

<p> I like to start friendships and keep them for a long time maybe even my whole life. I widen the
circle of friends for myself and others.There are many ways to be good at relating. I might easily meet
new people, learn their names, and make friends very quickly wherever I go. I might take time to
make friends, but I am good at building long-lasting friendships. I might do both. If I make friends
quickly, people probably view me as a happy, outgoing, and instantly likeable. If I would rather spend
time with a small group of friends talking, laughing, or just being together, these friends might see me as a
best friend they can trust and talk to. I might be best at relating with teachers, parents, and other adults,
and they can help me learn and feel good about myself. Whatever my style of relating, people like me
and relationships are important to me. </p>
